# ITE Resolver

Creation of an ITE tree based on the entered formula. Two ITE trees are created
in PDF format: One prior to simplification and one after simplification.

## Requirements
- Python
- Graphviz: *Follow installation instructions at https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html*

**Note:** If an installation manager (Windows: chocolatey, Mac: homebrew) is available, *graphviz* can simply be installed with it instead: `choco install graphviz` or  `brew install graphviz`.

## Execution

Run it by using the following command: `python drawIteTree.py`
